# Rock, Paper, Scissors - A Simple Python Game

This project is a straightforward implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" using Python. I created this script as a fun, quick exercise to demonstrate basic Python programming concepts, including user input, random choices, and conditional logic.

## How to Play

1.  **Run the script:** Execute the `rock_paper_scissors.py` file using a Python interpreter.
2.  **Make your choice:** When prompted, type either "rock," "paper," or "scissors" (case-sensitive) and press Enter.
3.  **See the results:** The computer's choice will be displayed, and the outcome of the round (win, lose, or tie) will be announced.
4.  **Play again:** You'll be asked if you want to play another round. Type "yes" to continue or "no" to exit.

## Features

* **User Input:** Accepts user input for their choice of move.
* **Random Computer Choice:** The computer's move is randomly selected from the available options.
* **Emoji Representation:** Uses emojis to visually represent the moves (rock, paper, scissors).
* **Clear Output:** Provides clear output indicating the user's and computer's choices, as well as the round's result.
* **Play Again Option:** Allows users to play multiple rounds without restarting the script.
* **Basic input validation:** Handles invalid user inputs.
